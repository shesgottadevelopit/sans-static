# Pink Lemonade (sans) HTML Boilerplate

## Summary
An HTML and CSS boilerplate project. This is also a learning exercise in creating a more robust static site generator, allowing for markdown usage and front matter incorporation in pages.

## Requirements
- [ ] Read a global site config file that include site title, description
- [ ] Read Nunjucks files
- [ ] Read Markdown files
- [ ] Read data from JSON or YAML files. This would include a list of posts or pages or anything I'd need to iterate over and the source of this information would come from actual files
- [ ] Compile the Markdown files (with the Frontmatter) and insert them into the Nunjucks files
- [ ] Compile the Nunjucks files and generate HTML pages
- [ ] Clean up URLs

## Completed
- [x] Include vendor styles & scripts in js/css folders
- [x] Review other boilerplate templates for pertinent implementations
- [x] update .edigorconfig (tab spaces or nah)

## In Progress
- [ ] What am I even doing right now?
