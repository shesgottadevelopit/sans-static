## Demystifying SSGs
What is a static site generator? "The basic concept of a static site generator (aka static site engine) is simple: take dynamic content and data and generate static HTML/JavaScript/CSS files that can be deployed to the server" from the command line. [Source](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/static-site-generators)

There are a lot of static site generators out there that I could've learned but I was already using Nunjucks as a templating engine and decided to see how I could build on that.

### What is frontmatter?
Frontmatter is the data at the front/top of your document. It is typically enclosed between two lines with 3 dashes. It can be extracted from the document and into a file-based data format for usage (e.g. JSON or YAML).
